Scene: A creepy ass hidden room. There is writing on the walls that says things like "Knifetank is coming" on the floor are two headless barbie dolls, one is female, the other is male.

Text: "It reeks of motor oil in here"

If player clicks on the doll on the right and doesn't have argyle knife then text "You lift up one of the headless doll and reveal an argyle Knife that was laying beneath it." Add An Argyle Knife to the inventory and text "You have An Argyle Knife."

If player clicks on the doll on the left and doesn't have blue key then text says "You pick up the headless doll and notice it's surprising weight. Suddenly a key falls out from under it." Add A Blue Key "You have A Blue Key."

If player clicks on a doll and does have An Argyle Knife then text "That's one way to get ahead in life."

If player clicks on back button then Closet.
