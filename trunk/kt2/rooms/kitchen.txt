In the kitchen we see a counter with dishes, a sink, cabinets, a knife sharpener, a plate with cheese on it, and a refrigerator. There is also an arrow to take the player back to the hallway.

On the fridge there is a crayon kids drawing of a tank with knives and some stick figure parents around the tank. This should be creepy.

If the player opens the fridge it will be filled with condiments, but no actual food. Just rows of ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonnaise, etc.


If the player clicks on the knife sharpener but does not have A Dull Knife the text will say "Plenty of knife sharpeners, but not a knife around."

If the player clicks on the knife sharpener and has A Dull Knife, the text will say "You hone the blade to a pristine edge sharp enough to cut through stuff." Then A Sharp Knife appears in the inventory and the text "You have A Sharp Knife." appears.


If the player clicks on the cheese, but does not have a knife, the text will say "That cheese looks delicious, but there's nothing around to cut it with."

If the player clicks on the cheese and has a dull knife the text says "You fail to cut the cheese.. your knife is too dull."

If the player clicks on the cheese and has a sharp knife the text says "With great ease you chop off a perfect slice of cheese and toss it in your mouthhole. It tastes like a warm summer day." This text then gets followed by "You have a happy." and A Happy is then placed in their inventory.


If the player clicks on the arrow he is taken back to Hallway.
