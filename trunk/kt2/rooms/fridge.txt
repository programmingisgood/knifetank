Scene: An open refrigerator. The fridge is full of ketchup, mustard, and a big jar of mayonnaise, but has no actual food. There is an area at the bottom of the screen to signify to the player they can back out.

If the player clicks on the jar of mayonnaise then show the text "You shovel a mouthful of mayonnaise down your throat and nearly choke on a key. Seriously, who leaves keys in a jar of mayonnaise?!" Then the text reads "You have red key." and the player gets Red Key added to their inventory.

If they player clicks on another bottle of anything, the text "Ew, gross!"

If the player clicks on the arrow he is taken back to Kitchen.
