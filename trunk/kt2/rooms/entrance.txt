Scene: Inside the entrance to this scary house. We see a set of old scary stairs, a hallway with photos hanging on it, an entrance to the living room, and a back arrow. 

Upon first entering the Entrance we will show the text "The door was unlocked so you just walk right in. Seems kind of rude, but whateverâ€¦"

If the player clicks on the steps, but doesn't have Tank Treads then show message "Those stairs look dangerous, perhaps you should find a safer way to travel up them."

If the player tries the steps again and still does not have Tank Treads take them to Stairdeath.

If the player has tank treads we will allow them to go to Upstairs.

If the player clicks on living room entrance we take them to Living.

If the player clicks on the hallway we will take them Hallway.

If the player clicks on the back button we will take them to House.
